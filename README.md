# photo-searchWrite 
a one-page app that uses a photo search API via AJAX to search for images and display them.  

This app is using the flickr api

1.  The images should be in a vertically scrolling area and the search field should stay on the screen.  
2.  When the user hits enter or presses the search button, it should refresh the display with the new results.  (Please set ‘safe search’ or 'content filter' to the safest setting for the results.)
3.  Show the first 20 images.
4.  Images in the scrolling areas should be displayed as large as possible, while still fitting on-screen fully.  If they don't reach the left and right edges of the display, they should be centered.
